There are several libraries that can be used for training CNN.

<p></p>

<h3> Theano </h3>

<p>
"Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize,
and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays efficiently."

<h3> Pylearn2 </h3>

<p>
"Pylearn2 is a machine learning library. Most of its functionality
is built on top of Theano. This means you can write Pylearn2
plugins (new models, algorithms, etc) using mathematical expressions,
and theano will optimize and stabilize those expressions for you, and
compile them to a backend of your choice (CPU or GPU)."

<h3> OverFeat </h3>

<p>
"OverFeat is an image recognizer and feature extractor built around
a convolutional network.
</p>

<p>
The OverFeat convolutional net was trained on the ImageNet 1K dataset.
It participated in the ImangeNet Large Scale Recognition Challenge 2013
under the name “OverFeat NYU”.
</p>


<p>
This release provides C/C++ code to run the network and output class
probabilities or feature vectors. It also includes a webcam-based demo."
