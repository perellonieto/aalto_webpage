These are some references I read during my master's thesis.
They contain the original abstract and my own notes. Some
of the notes are textual parts of the original references,
however other notes are just my own interpretation.

It is also avaliable in html and LaTeX format :
[
<a href="thesis/summaries_html/summaries.html" style="color:blue">html</a>

<a href="thesis/summaries_pdf/summaries.pdf" style="color:blue">pdf</a>
]
